    Project Detail

a. General Description

“Automated Alarm System” is an alarm system which monitors and controls fire and security alarms throughout a building. An alarm may be activated and in a control room security personnel may act on the incident themselves or call it in, although the alarm system will have intelligence to operate if personnel are absent. If a call is not responded to within 3 minutes, the system will call the fire station and/or police. If the security personnel decides to investigate the alarm, they have 7 minutes to cancel the alarm, or the system will automatically escalate the emergency. Security personnel can resolve an issue remotely from a mobile device. False alarms are avoided by having multiple alarms activated, or manually escalating by security personnel. The alarm system will know if certain rooms in the building are occupied, as this may effect how certain emergency situations are handled.

The alarm system must be able to properly work on a building that has multiple floors and floors can be broken into different zones. Some zones may have exit indicators that illuminate to direct people where to exit. Some zones will also have automatic door locks that are activated if there is a security alarm to isolate areas if needed.

b. Reason and Main Goal

Make an automated alarm system that can supervise a building’s fire and security issues with or without a maned security center.
